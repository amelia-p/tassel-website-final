            <h3>Providing an English Education</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="english_education">
            <p>We provide free, high-quality English education to poor children in rural villages. English is a fundamental skill 
                needed in Cambodia, not just for jobs, but more importantly for the nation itself to gain knowledge in all disciplines. 
                Highly educated people, 90% of all teachers and doctors, were killed in the 1970s by the Khmer Rouge, and the nation 
                cannot rebuild itself without re-education of the country itself. The majority of university-level textbooks, however, 
                are available only in English. Furthermore, much of non-textbook high-level learning occurs through interactions with 
                foreigners, thus, English language education is mandatory.

                Although the country has now acknowledged the need for English education, quality English education does not exist in 
                most of rural Cambodia. TASSEL has English schools in five villages (Banan, Samrang, Kampong Puoy, Jeepan, and Rattinak) 
                and currently provides free, daily, high-quality English classes to approximately 3,500 students. The children are placed 
                in different curricula according to placement tests and study 80 minutes per day, four times a week. The children are 
                taught not only English but also good study habits and values. They are given daily homework and monthly exams. Daily 
                attendance is mandatory, and students with poor monthly test scores are not allowed to continue with the program. 
                Cambodian teachers, trained by TASSEL international volunteers, teach children reading, writing, listening and speaking 
                skills.

        <div id="heading_t">
            <h3>Teaching</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="teaching">
            <p>Volunteers from all over the world help teach our TASSEL students year round. Through an online - zoom-like - platform 
                called VSEE, a teacher will lead a 35-minute lesson. These structured lesson plans often involve the teacher going 
                over the alphabet - vowels and consonants - with the class before moving on to forming phrases and then complex sentences. 
                TASSEl heavily emphasizes on correcr grammar usage and sentence structure, aiming to provide a complete and throughout
                breakdown of the English language. In addition to the native-speaking teaching directing the majority of the lesson, we
                also have some Khmer teachers in-person in the classes to translate and provide further instruction for the students. Our 
                Khmer teachers are also considered fluent in English, and serve to help make sure the lessons go smoothly on VSEE, given that
                the native English-speaking teacher is not there in person to provide additional guidance. Furthermore, while some volunteer
                teachers will be assigned to classes full of students, another teaching assignemnt available is TASSEL Video and Speaking.
                This program within TASSEL serves to train our Khmer teachers, whether it be improving their English or keeping up with 
                with the language.</p>

            <h3>Creating Jobs</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="teaching_jobs">
            <p>As the nation still grossly lacks quality teachers, an important function of TASSEL is creating teaching jobs as well 
                as training, fundraising for and caring for teachers. TASSEL visits Cambodian university campuses to encourage young 
                adults to choose teaching as their profession. After recruiting high-potential candidates, TASSEL provides them with 
                continuous training, funding and care. The Cambodian teachers have quickly become the core of the TASSEL family. They 
                not only teach but proactively tend to the psychological and emotional needs of the children, family members, and 
                villagers. The teachers are at the forefront of family visits and distribute food, medicine and clothes house by house.
            </p>

        <div id="heading_fa">
            <h3>Providing Food Aid</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="food_aid"> 
            <p>Many of TASSEL's students and their families are not eating enough. Sixty percent of rural families face seasonal food 
                shortages (no food during the dry season or before rice harvest season), and the poorest have yearlong food shortages. 
                Many children work throughout the week, helping on the farm or collecting snails, frogs, fish or plants to eat. In 
                order to help the children concentrate on studying, TASSEL provides food aid to families who truly have limited 
                income-earning capability. TASSEL also provides food aid to other villagers, especially the elderly, who have no 
                relatives or caretakers.
            </p>

        <div id="heading_ma">
            <h3>Providing Medical Aid</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="medical_aid">
            <p>A lack of clean water, nutrition, poor hygiene, and severe climate conditions contribute to poor health among many 
                villagers. However, the majority of families in rural Cambodia have no access to quality health care. In most villages 
                there are no doctors, and most cannot afford to pay for transportation (eg. a $5 tuk-tuk ride) to go to town to visit 
                clinics, let alone pay for medical bills. In 2016, TASSEL started to provide healthcare service to the neediest villagers. 
                This includes helping with medical bills, providing ibuprofen and vitamins and taking patients to hospitals in the cities 
                and even Thailand for the more serious cases.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="heading_ec">
            <h3>Providing Emotional Care</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="emotional_care">
            <p>Arguably worse than physical poverty for rural Cambodians is the sense of hopelessness and loneliness. Many are still 
                haunted by the memory of the Khmer Rouge era, when they were forced into slavery and had to endure family deaths, 
                torture, violence, illness and starvation. Many continue to suffer these same hardships as well as from government 
                corruption and/or PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Although free English lessons, food and medical aid are all 
                important, truly giving from our hearts and tending to their hearts is probably the most important aspect of TASSEL's 
                daily activities.

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="mission_text">
        <p>TASSEL is a non-profit organization focused on changing the lives of rural Cambodians through English education; 
            the creation of teaching jobs; food and medicine aid; and sponsorships. Although once a dominant regional empire 
            for more than 600 years, Cambodia still has not recovered from the the trauma brought on by the Khmer Rouge, a 
            brutal regime that took hold over Cambodia during 1970s. Ninety percent of teachers and doctors were killed during 
            that time.  Although socioeconomic progress is being made, Cambodia remains one the of the poorest nations in the 
            world. A key bottleneck in this country is the lack of schools and teachers and the ability for students to learn 
            English.  Universities depend on English language textbooks but most cannot fully comprehend them. Providing free 
            English education to children in rural areas allows them to access higher education and lift Cambodia out of poverty. 
            TASSEL also provides food and medical aid to the poorest children and families with no wage-earning members. The 
            organization is built on a foundation of service and community, impacting the hearts of students, teachers, villagers 
            and volunteers alike. TASSEL puts utmost emphasis on serving from the heart. Many Cambodians suffer from severe anxiety 
            and depression. But hearts do get transformed by compassion. TASSEL mainly focuses on the recruitment of high school and 
            university students to volunteer for online classroom teaching positions. This is because TASSEL knows that youths can 
            greatly touch children in a way adults can't. As well, TASSEL understands that youths will be leading the future of 
            humanitarianism.  However, participation by adults (parents, teachers and more) is equally important as they have unique 
            ways of sharing their particular gifts.

        <h3>History: The Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian Genocide</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="history_text"> <!-- from the United Nations: "The Spectre of the Khmer Rouge over Cambodia"-->
        <p>The Khmer Rouge started as a small communist insurgency against Prince Norodom Sihanouk's neutralist Government in 
            the Cold War, and grew into a terror regime during its rule from April 1975 to January 1979. Massive bombings of eastern 
            Cambodia by the United States (1969-1973) and the overthrow of Sihanouk by a pro-American right-wing general in March 1970 
            radicalized the rural youth, turning many of them into the arms of the regime. The enraged Prince embraced Pol Pot, leader 
            of the Khmer Rouge in Beijing , thereby opening the flood gates of Chinese arms to the Khmer Rouge and contributing to its 
            meteoric rise.
<!-- from the Illinois Holocause Museum-->
            On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge cadres marched into Phnom Penh and began their social revolution. In the name of Angkar, 
            the Khmer Rouge entered the cities, forced all residents out of their home and to walk into the countryside. The cadres 
            conducted summary executions for all known former opponents of the Khmer Rouge and those regarded hostile to the regime. 
            The Khmer Rouge claimed they were “purifying” the entire population by moving them into the countryside to achieve a “Super 
            Great Leap Forward” and turning all Cambodians into peasant farmers. Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge sought to socially 
            transform Cambodia by changing ideological superstructures, institutions, and political systems, which would reconfigure
            social relations and daily life. They wanted to destroy all that came before and “turn back the clock” and start at “year 
            zero". The Khmer Rouge then facilitated violence as a way of “purifying” the country. 
<!-- from the University of Minnesota Holocause and Genocide Studies page-->
            Lasting for four years (between 1975 and 1979), the Cambodian Genocide was an explosion of mass violence that saw between 
            1.5 and 3 million people killed through execution, exhaustion and starvation at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Over 90% of 
            Cambodia's teachers and doctors were killed during this time. During the Khmer Rouge's brutal four-year rule, they were 
            responsible for the deaths of nearly a quarter of all Cambodians. Since the end of the Cambodian genocide in 1979, the country 
            has struggled to recover from the loss of its intellectuals and community leaders. Many civilians today continue to face 
            hardships in education, poverty, domestic violence and alcoholism - consequences that stem from the aftermath of the genocide.

        </div>
        <div id="schools_and_chapters">
            <p>With schools across 8 villages in Cambodia's northwestern Battambang province, TASSEL strives to continue to build more 
                education centers for our students. Our volunteer teachers come from various TASSEL "chapters" around the world. With 
                chapters based in Los Angeles, Seoul, Tokyo, etc., volunteers from each chapter contribute to our mission in many ways 
                - whether it be raising money, teaching or spreading awareness. If you have a heart to serve the underserved and are 
                willing to commit your time to TASSEL, we welcome you to join our cause. We believe that everyone involved with TASSEL is 
                making a difference and healing the hearts of those with whom we interact. If you attend a high school, university, or a 
                church where there is already a TASSEL "chapter" (official or unofficial), please contact the Chapter President (see

        </div>
        <div id="teach_remotely">
            <p>If you are qualified and selected (contact your Chapter President for details), you can teach English remotely to either a 
                specific group of children or Cambodian teachers in rural Cambodia. The following classes are available for you to teach: <br />
                    - Phonics <br />
                    - Reading/Conversation <br />
                    - Paragraph Writing <br />
                    - Essay Writing <br />
                For Phonics and Reading/Conversation, you teach "live" over video-conference to a group of approximately 20 children or to 
                individual teachers at a specific time each week. For Writing, you will be assigned students with whom you will communicate 
                bi-weekly via a Cloud Folder. Through your classes, you will share not only English skills but also compassion and kindness 
                with your Cambodian students.

                we need to provide food aid to the poorest families who are not capable of earning their own. We also need to provide access 
                to medicine and healthcare. Chapter members help raise awareness about the financial needs of the people we serve. Many give

            <p>For those who have taught remotely, you can come to teach the children in person! While long-distance teaching is effective 
                and necessary for the children to receive continuous education, in-class teaching sessions during the summer, where there 
                is a dynamic interaction between you and the children, are invaluable to the children's (and your) learning experience. 
                When you come to Cambodia, you will be assigned to a teaching team of two to three volunteers who, upon further training, 
                will co-teach three times a day to a total of about 100 children over four days. <br /> <br />
            
                The majority of chapters have members joining on a 10-day service trip to Cambodia during the summer. The trip solely 
                focuses on service. Nine out of the ten days consist of family visits; food, medicine and clothes distribution; training; 
                and teaching. There is no sightseeing except on the final day. Trip scheduling and assignments are finalized during 
                February-April within chapters. The summer service trip is an integral part of TASSEL's activity, as it not only helps 
                the people of Cambodia but is also an invaluable way for volunteers to learn in-depth about the problems we need to address.

            <h3>TASSEL Origins</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="tassel_origins"> 
            <p>In 2011, Mr. Joji Tatsugi retired from the business world. He created TASSEL in 2012 to serve not only the poor but also 
                youths and adults in developed nations so that the next generation can be equipped to eradicate poverty.  He believes 
                education, and importantly English language education, is critical in helping nations such as Cambodia get out of 
                poverty.
                <br />
                <br />
                A Note from the Founder of TASSEL: <br />
                "I really could not have imagined how impactful TASSEL could be when I left the corporate world in 2011 to start this 
                journey.  In 2012, the TASSEL family consisted of two Cambodian teachers, six U.S. volunteers, and 60 Cambodian children. 
                As of 2024, we now have 43 Cambodian teachers, 800 international volunteers and over 3,500 Cambodian students. But the
                numbers in themselves are not meaningful. What truly is meaningful is how the growth has happened. The growth has 
                happened because of hearts transforming hearts... As a field worker who sees your love in action transforming the locals every day, 
                and who also sees you being transformed by the locals, I know what happens when hearts transform hearts. I am truly 
                blessed to be working with you every day and to be witnessing all of these miracles on a daily basis."
